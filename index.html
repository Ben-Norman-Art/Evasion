<p class="ex1" style="color:white">For this Game Demo, I titled this 
  game "Evasion" with the main concept of a player avoiding astroids coming down from the sky. 
  This was made in p5.js and the pixelated backgrounds, astroids and character were made in Piskel.com. 
  The concept revolved around the idea that people will try to avoid things that make them uncomfortable 
  as much as the can. However, sooner or later it will become too overwelming and consume the person. 
  There would also be times where when times of overwelming stress, people would like to be hit by a astroid. 
  Overall this game was able to help me get more advanced into gaming developments.
